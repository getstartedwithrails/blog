I'm writing a book about getting started with Rails.

It's my way to force myself to learn Rails and I hope by documenting the process, it may help others.  I welcome feedback and tips from all who care to share, and if I find your help useful, I will credit you in the book.

You will soon be able to download a sample chapter and outline.  

I am accepting pre-orders, and you can also register to be notified when it's available.  Most of the content will also be available for free here on this site.
