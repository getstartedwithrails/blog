Hi, I'm Aaron Evans, the author of "Get Started with Rails" and host of this blog.

I first used Ruby on Rails in 2005 after seeing the webcast by David Heinemeier Hansson and reading the tutorial "Rolling with Ruby on Rails" (part 1 and 2).  I've dabbled a bit with Rails off and on since then, and used Ruby a bit for test automation, but I never really delved into it.  This is my attempt to force myself to learn Rails the right way.

I'm a freelance consultant specializing in test automation with open source tools.  One Shore is my test consulting business.

I've lived in Ecuador and Fiji (hence the "fijiaaron" moniker) and all over the USA.  I'm currently living in Utah with my wife and three --soon to be four-- kids.  We're trying to decide where to go next.
